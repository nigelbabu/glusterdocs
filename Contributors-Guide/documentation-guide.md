# Documentation guide

If you are contributing documentation for the Gluster project, please keep
these recommendations in mind for all your changes.

## English style
* Use active voice.
* Titles should be in sentence case. For example, "Grammar Rules" is
  incorrect. "Grammar rules" is correct. However, if the word is a proper noun,
  format it according to its correct format. For example, "Setup SELinux".

## Formatting
* Use a $ or # at the start of the command to indicate that whether the shell
  is a unprivileged or privileged

    $ echo "This is an unprivileged shell"
    $ sudo su -
    # echo "This is a root shell"
